            Our website uses cookies. A cookie is a file containing an
            identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web
            server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier
            is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a
            page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or
            “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web
            browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless
            deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the
            other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web
            browser is closed. Cookies do not typically contain any information
            that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we
            store about you may be linked to the information stored in and
            obtained from cookies. We use both session and persistent cookies on
            our website. The names of the cookies that we use on our website,
